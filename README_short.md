# Hash table (Python)

Set of programming assignments that are designed to test knowledge of hash table data structure.

## Problem 1: Implement HashTable with chaining

Implement a HashTable interface **without using any hash table libraries**.


## Problem 2: Find two numbers that add up to a given target

Given an array of integers `values` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.


## Problem 3: Repeated DNA Sequences

Given a string `dna_sequence` that represents a **DNA sequence**, return all the `8`**-letter-long** sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in **any order**.
